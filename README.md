# Baby-Blockchain

build a simple blockchain that shows the fundamental concepts of the blockchain data structure 
used by many blockchain apps like Bitcoin.

### the Big Idea

a blockchain is a data structure where information is stored in a relatively new kind way.

The basic concept of blockchain is quite simple: a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of 
ordered records. However, it is easy to get mixed up as usually when we talk about blockchains we also talk about the 
problems we are trying to solve with them. This is the case in the popular blockchain-based projects such as 
Bitcoin and Ethereum . 
The term “blockchain” is usually strongly tied to concepts like transactions, smart contracts or cryptocurrencies.
